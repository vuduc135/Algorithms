# GCPD (Greatest Common Prime Divisor) is defined as the largest prime number that divides both given positive integers. Your task is to find GCPD of the given integers a and b.
# Example
# For a = 12 and b = 18, the output should be greatestCommonPrimeDivisor(a, b) = 3;
# For a = 12 and b = 13, the output should be greatestCommonPrimeDivisor(a, b) = -1.
# Input/Output
# [execution time limit] 0.5 seconds
# [input] integer a
# Guaranteed constraints: 2 ≤ a ≤ 150.
# [input] integer b
# Guaranteed constraints: 2 ≤ b ≤ 150.
# [output] integer
# GCPD of a and b or -1 if it doesn't exist.
